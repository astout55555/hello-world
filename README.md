# hello-world
For practicing the GitHub flow.
I'm an aspiring software developer, and I could use a little focused review on working with GitHub.

The "hello-world" repo is where I'm practicing using some basic git commands. I'm more familiar with pushing than pulling, and it's my first time doing work on GitHub before setting up the local repo.
